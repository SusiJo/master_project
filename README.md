# Master Project



This repository relates to my master thesis: **ML-based gene expression profiling of publicly available RNA-Seq data**.



## Documentation

The documentation is built with Read The Docs and can only be accessed locally after cloning the repo.
Please check-out the `python_scripts/environment.yml` to ensure the necessary packages are installed.
The webpage can be built from the `docs` folder with `make clean && make html`.
